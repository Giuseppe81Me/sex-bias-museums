\section{Abstract}

Natural history specimens are widely used across ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation.
Although biological sex may influence all of these areas, it is often overlooked in large-scale studies using specimens. 
If collections are biased towards one sex, studies may not be representative of the species. 
Here, we investigate sex ratios in over two million bird and mammal specimen records from five large international museums. 
We found a slight bias towards males in birds (40\% females) and mammals (48\% females), but this varied among orders. 
The proportion of female specimens has not significantly changed in 130 years, but decreased in species with “showy” male traits like colourful plumage and horns. 
Body size had little effect. 
Male bias was strongest in name-bearing types; only 27\% of bird and 39\% of mammal types were female. 
These results imply that previous studies may be impacted by undetected male bias, and vigilance is required when using specimen data, collecting new specimens, and designating types.

\section{Introduction}\label{main}
Museum specimens are used extensively in studies of taxonomy, systematics, biogeography, genomics, comparative anatomy, morphological variability, development, parasitology, stable isotope ecology, toxicology, morphological evolution and more\cite{lister2011natural,pyke2010biological,mclean2015natural}. 
They are also of vital importance for understanding how biodiversity responds to anthropogenic impacts\cite{meineke2018biological}. 
Large studies of species phenotypes using museum specimens, especially in vertebrates, are becoming increasingly common (e.g.\cite{cooney2017mega,felice2018developmental}) and are revealing new insights into the evolution of diversity. 
These studies require large amounts of data, which can mean the focus is on collecting data from as many species as possible, to the detriment of other sources of variation. 
Sex is an important factor that influences many aspects of an individual's ecology and life-history (Table \ref{table_consequences}), but it is often treated as a nuisance variable, overlooked entirely, or data collection focuses on just one sex (e.g.\cite{cooper2009factors}) to avoid the issue. 
If natural history collections have unbiased sex ratios (i.e. close to 50\% males and females, or reflective of the sex ratio for the species in the wild\cite{karlin1986theoretical}) then this may not be a problem; if there is a bias in the sex composition of collections, this has implications for studies that assume their samples are representative of the whole population or species (Table \ref{table_consequences}). 
No large-scale study of sex ratios in museum collections exists, therefore investigating this is of vital importance as the number of studies using museum specimens continue to rise (e.g. this recent special issue\cite{meineke2018biological}).

Here we investigate sex biases in natural history collections of birds and mammals using 2,496,328 specimen records from five major international museums.
We find a slight bias towards males in both groups.
%Male bias may be the result of deliberate selection of males, either by collectors in the field or curators accessioning specimens, trapping biases (i.e. trapping method, season of collecting, conspicuous male behaviors or traits) or in some cases simply because there were more males in a population. 
%Collectors may also actively avoid collecting females with young due to legislation, ethical or conservation considerations. 
%In particular a major suspected source of male bias in collections is deliberate selection for large, ``impressive'' male specimens, especially where males are larger or more colourful than females, or possess ornaments such as horns or antlers. 
%Conventional wisdom also suggests that some male bias may be related to the age of the collections, therefore, we expect male bias to decrease towards the present due to changes in collection methods and motivations over the last century. 
%To investigate these biases further, we tested whether male bias differed among orders, with sexual size dimorphism, with the possession of colourful plumage (birds) or ornamentation (mammals) in males, and through time.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Data collection and cleaning}
\subsubsection{Specimen data} 
We obtained museum bird and mammal collection records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF\cite{gbif}). 
Specifically we collated data from the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH; $n = 271,407$ records\cite{amnh-birds,amnh-mammals}), Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH; $n = 182,984$ records\cite{fmnh-birds,fmnh-mammals}), Mus\'{e}um National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN; $n = 86,126$ records\cite{mnhn-birds,mnhn-mammals}), National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (NMNH; $n = 496,735$ records\cite{smithsonian-both}), and Natural History Museum, London (NHMUK; $n = 251,409$\cite{nhm-all}).
These specimens were obtained between 1751 and 2018, mostly through hunting or trapping, and sexed based on external genitalia or secondary sexual characters, for example plumage colouration or antlers.
All raw data can be downloaded from GBIF\cite{gbif}.
 
Prior to analyses we cleaned the data as follows. 
(i) Record type. To avoid confusing specimens with archives describing specimens we selected only preserved specimen records; 
(ii) Age. Juveniles can be harder to sex so we excluded all juveniles, young and foetuses from the dataset; 
(iii) Year. We removed invalid collection years (i.e. years later than 2018); 
(iv) Taxonomy. We removed subspecies names and used species binomials because we were interested in species-level sex ratios. 
To ensure our results were not due to female specimens more frequently being identified to the genus-level only, we also also created a dataset with all specimens with valid generic names.
We corrected bird taxonomy using the GBIF backbone taxonomy\cite{gbif}, and mammal taxonomy using Mammal Species of the World\cite{wilson2005mammal}; 
(v) Type status. We split types into name bearing (Holotype, Syntype, Lectotype, Neotype) and non-name bearing (Paratype, Paralectotype, Paraneotype, Allotype, Topotype, Cotype) types. Where the records did not specify the kind of type we define these as ambiguous types; 
(vi) Sex. We standardized sex to either Female, Male or non-sexed, and removed the five intersex or hermaphrodite individuals. 
Note that we recognise that biological sex is a spectrum\cite{sciam2017}. 
We focus here on specimens identified as females and males for simplicity because there were very few recorded intersex specimens in collections databases, but we recognize the importance of these individuals.
We also excluded non-sexed individuals from the analyses.
The final dataset contained 2,496,611 specimens (1,395,748 birds and 1,100,863 mammals), 1,647,409 (708,355 birds and 939,054 mammals) of which were sexed (Table AX - genus level).

\subsubsection{Sexual dimorphism, plumage coloration and ornamentation data.}
We extracted median body masses (g) for males and females from Lislevand et al.\cite{lislevand2007avian} for birds and Jones et al.\cite{pantheria} for mammals, then calculated sexual size dimorphism by dividing mean male body mass by female body mass. 
Note that the sample size for these variables is lower because sex disaggregated body size data are rare (see Table numbers).

To explore how ``showiness'' might influence sex bias, we included a measure of plumage coloration for passerine birds taken from Dale et al.\cite{dale2015data,dale2015effects}. 
This measure is based on the mean RGB (red green blue) values for 400 randomly chosen pixels in six patches (nape, crown, forehead, throat, upper breast, and lower breast) for each sex. 
We then calculated a plumage dimorphism score by dividing male plumage score by female score for each species. 
For mammals, we used the Handbook of Mammals of the World to identify mammals where males have ornamentation. 
We defined ornamentation as a feature that might increase the likelihood of a collector targeting an individual, specifically horns, antlers, tusks, well-defined manes (i.e. in lions and some baboons), enlarged nasal appendages (e.g. in elephant seals and proboscis monkeys), or facial colouration (e.g. in mandrills) or large cheek pouches (e.g. orangutans). 
Where species had ornaments, we recorded whether both sexes or only males routinely possess them. 
The majority of species with ornaments were Artiodactyla (203 of 232 species). 
Other ornamented species were walruses, beaked whales, narwhals, rhinoceroses, okapis, and elephants, however only artiodactyls and the walrus were represented by more than 100 specimens in the dataset (see below), so were the only species to appear in our models (see Table numbers).

We do not have body size data for all species (see Table numbers), and only have plumage data (see below) for passerines, but some bird species show reverse sexual dimorphism, where females are larger or showier than the males. 
To see if we detect a different pattern in these species we also divided the bird data into species where the female is generally the larger or showier sex (the families  Accipitridae, Falconidae, Scolopacidae, Charadriidae, Jacanidae, Stercorariidae, Sulidae, Fregatidae, Cuculidae, Trochilidae, Pipridae, and the orders Strigiformes and Struthioniformes\cite{swaddle2000novel}), and species where the male is generally the larger or showier sex (all other species). 

The final cleaned data are available on the NHM Data Portal \cite{sex-bias-data}. 

\subsection{Analyses}
We analysed bird and mammal data separately and performed all analyses in R version 3.5.0\cite{R}. 
Reproducible scripts are available on GitHub at https://github.com/nhcooper123/sex-bias-museums [we will add a zenodo link on acceptance].

We first summarised the overall proportion of female, male and unsexed specimens, and calculated the median proportion of females across species (using the main dataset) and genera (using the generic level dataset). 
We then summarised differences in the proportion of female specimens across orders and types. 

Unsexed specimens may bias our results toward males if the majority of unsexed specimens are female. 
Therefore we tested this by fitting linear models to compare the percentage of unsexed specimens and the percentage of female specimens within species; if this is an issue we expect to see a negative relationship between unsexed specimens and the number of females in a species. 
In addition, we investigated variation in the numbers of unsexed specimens by order, collection continent and collection decade (see Supplementary Methods).

Most species were represented by only a few specimens (Figure A1), with large skews towards either males or females at low numbers (Figure A2). 
To reduce problems this is likely to cause when fitting models, we used only species with 100 or more specimens in our models (see Supplementary Methods for more details), except in our change-through-time models. 
In these models our response variable was the proportion of males and females in each species for each year from 1880-2010 (before 1880 and after 2010 we did not have any species with sufficient specimens to include). 
As there were only 55 bird species and 1,216 mammal species with over 100 specimens in a year, change-through-time models instead used all species with more than 50 specimens in a single year to increase the sample size (see Table numbers).

We fitted all models using generalised linear models (GLM) with quasibinomial errors, with the proportion of female specimens (success) and the proportion of male specimens (failure) for each species as the response variable (i.e. a binomial response where the number of females and the number of males for each species were jointly modeled). 
Quasibinomial rather than binomial errors were used due to overdispersion (all models have deviance/residual degrees of freedom far greater than two; see output on GitHub for exact values), and we assessed the significance of model terms using Type II sums of squares. 
We used standard model checks for GLMs (Q-Q plot, histogram of residuals, residuals vs. linear predictors, response vs. fitted values) to assess model fit. 
We tested whether the proportion of female and male specimens varied with (i) orders; (ii) collection years (1880-2010); (iii) male body mass (log transformed); (iv) sexual size dimorphism (log transformed); (v) whether males were larger/more showy than females or vice versa (reverse sexual dimorphism; birds only); (vi) plumage dimorphism (log transformed; passerine birds only); and (vii) ornamentation (mammals only). 
The number of specimens and species in each model are shown in Table numbers.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Of the 2,496,328 specimen records (1,395,748 birds and 1,100,580 mammals) in our dataset, 20\% of bird specimens were female, 31\% were male, and 49\% were not sexed (Table AX - genus level). 
For mammals, the number of non-sexed individuals were much lower at 15\%, likely because it is easier to identify sex in mammals, with 41\% female and 44\% male specimens. 
If we consider only sexed specimens, 40\% of bird and 48\% of mammal specimens were female (Figure A3). 
In real terms this represents 143,905 more male than female specimens in birds and 40,468 more male specimens in mammals. 
This male bias was not due to unsexed specimens mostly being female (see Supplementary Materials; Figures A-A).
Results were also qualitatively similar using the generic-level data (Table AX - genus level), so we focus only on species-level data below.

In the wild, adult sex ratios in many bird species are male skewed, though on average not as skewed as our results (n = 187 species, median 44.8\% female\cite{szekely2014sex}; see Supplementary Materials; Figure AX), however, 48\% is not a large deviation from the 50\% expected in many natural populations of mammals\cite{karlin1986theoretical}.
Species with the most extreme sex ratios in our data, i.e. species with fewer than 25\% female or fewer than 25\% male specimens, for species with at least 100 specimens in total, are shown in Table A2.

\subsection{Variation among orders.} 
The proportion of female specimens varied across orders for both birds ($F_{24, 1721} = 29.81$, $p < 0.001$; Figure \ref{fig-bird_order_six}; Figure A4; Table A2) and mammals ($F_{24, 1488} = 19.80$, $p < 0.001$; Figure \ref{fig-mammal_order_six}; Figure A5; Table A2). 
Most orders had more males than females (Table A2). 
In birds, of the 25 orders with sufficient data, only tinamous (Tinamiformes; 50.4\%) had more females, but these represented just four species in the dataset. 
The most male-biased orders with more than 25 species were pigeons and doves (Columbiformes; 36.8\% female), hummingbirds and swifts (Apodiformes; 37.2\%; see Figure AX), and passerines (Passeriformes; 38.4\%). 
Adult sex ratios in Columbiformes and Passeriformes are generally male-skewed\cite{szekely2014sex,bosque2019skewed,mayr1939sex}, but hummingbirds are often female-skewed in the wild\cite{szekely2014sex,mayr1939sex}. 
This, along with evidence that, on average, Passeriformes are not as male biased as our results ($n = 54$ species, median 45.1\% female\cite{szekely2014sex}), suggests that greater availability of males alone cannot account for our results.

Seven of the 25 mammalian orders with sufficient data had more females, the most extreme being anteaters and sloths (Pilosa; 71.1\% female). 
Most mammal species have a sex ratio of 1:1 at birth\cite{karlin1986theoretical}, though this can vary in adults. 
Several species of sloth have higher numbers of females (up to 68.8\% females\cite{reyes2015informacion}) which may explain why we also found more females in collections, however, giant anteaters (\textit{Myrmecophaga tridactyla}) show strong male bias in the field (e.g.\cite{defreitas2015}), but strong female bias in collections (71.3\% female). 
Among the orders represented by more than 25 species in our data, only bats have more females (Chiroptera; 52.2\% female; Figure \ref{fig-mammal_order_six}), despite reportedly balanced adult sex ratios in the wild\cite{altringham}. 
This is likely related to widespread sex segregation in bat roosting sites, with many roosts containing individuals of only one sex\cite{altringham}. 
In the the past, bats were often trapped by collecting all individuals in a roost site, and female bats use fewer roost sites than males (e.g.\cite{encarnaccao2012spatiotemporal}), so skew towards females is not surprising. 
The most male-biased order of mammals were the even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla; 39.7\% females), but although they exhibit a great deal of variation in adult sex ratio, on average, there are more females than males in wild populations\cite{berger1999sex} suggesting strong selection for male specimens in this order derived from the trophy hunting of large males that was common in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Changes through time.}
We found male bias increased for birds ($F_{1, 389} = 7.167$, $p = 0.008$; Figure AX), but decreased for mammals ($F_{1, 3426} = 6.86$, $p = 0.009$; Figure AX), however the effect sizes were extremely small (birds: $slope \pm SE = -0.002 \pm < 0.001$; mammals: $slope \pm SE = 0.001 \pm < 0.001$), indicating very little change in either class, i.e. there has been no improvement in the sex balance of collecting over the last 130 years.

\subsection{Male body mass and sexual size dimorphism.}
We found significant effects of male body size on the proportion of female specimens in both birds and mammals (Table A3), however, the direction and strength of the relationship varied among classes and orders (Figure \ref{fig-male-mass}; Figures A6-A7; Table A3). 
Bird species with larger males tended to have more female specimens, whereas the reverse was true for mammals. 
In mammals this was likely driven by a few orders with large males that have long been favored in collections (e.g. Artiodactyla, Carnivora) and have low median percentages of female specimens (Figure \ref{fig-mammal_order_six}, Table A2). 
Interestingly however, selection for males in these groups did not increase with increasing male body size (Figure A7), instead it appears male carnivores and artiodactyls were preferred over females, regardless of their body size.

% figure 4
\begin{figure}
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{figures/male-mass-all.png}

  The dashed line represents 50\% female specimens. 
  Note that the x-axis scales are different for birds and mammals.
}
  \label{fig-male-mass}
\end{figure}

Rather than selecting large males \textit{per se}, collectors may favour males when the difference in size between females and males, i.e. sexual size dimorphism, is large. 
We found that as sexual size dimorphism increased, i.e. as males became increasingly larger than females, there was more bias towards male specimens (Table A3), however, this result was entirely driven by differences among orders (Figure A8 and A9); when order was included in the models, sexual size dimorphism did not significantly influence specimen sex ratios over the effects of order (Table A3). 
As with body mass, this suggested certain orders were more likely to contain more male specimens, regardless of their size with respect to females, suggesting that other characteristics were driving their selection.

In birds that show reverse sexual dimorphism we found that the median percentage of females for species where the male was the larger or showier sex was 40\%, the same as for the whole dataset. 
For species where the female is the larger or showier sex the median percentage of females was 44.6\%, closer to the expected 50:50 ratio.
 There were significantly more females in species where the female is the larger or showier sex ($F_{1, 1744} = 167.9$, $p < 0.001$; Figure AX)

\subsection{Plumage and ornaments.} 
In passerine birds, as males became increasingly more colorful than females, the proportion of female specimens decreased (Figure \ref{fig-plumage}; $F_{1, 828} = 58.95$, $p < 0.001$; $slope \pm SE = -0.416 \pm 0.054$). 
This relationship was not strong, but fits with anecdotal evidence of collections preferentially selecting, and displaying\cite{machin2008}, colorful male specimens, especially where plumage differences are large, for example in birds of paradise. 

% figure 5
\begin{figure}

  Only species with at least 100 specimens are included. 
  The dashed line represents 50\% female specimens; the dotted line is the point at which males and females have the same plumage coloration. 
  Plumage dimorphism scores were calculated by dividing male plumage scores by female plumage scores (see Methods). 
}
  \label{fig-plumage}
\end{figure}

For mammals, species with ornaments (horns, antlers, tusks, manes etc.) had significantly fewer female specimens than those without ornaments (Figure \ref{fig-orn}; $F_{1, 1510} = 46.98$, $p < 0.001$; $slope \pm SE = -0.328 \pm 0.048$). 
Note, however, that only 67 species across four orders in our analyses had ornamentation (Table ornnumbers}).
Most of the species with ornaments in our models were artiodactyls, and all artiodactyls have horns or tusks, suggesting that the strong male bias in Artiodactyla (39.7\% female; Figure \ref{fig-mammal_order_six}) was due to selection for males with these features. 
Within ornamented species there was no significant difference if both sexes or only males possessed the ornament (Figure \ref{fig-orn}; $F_{1, 65} = 0.725$, $p = 0.398$), suggesting that even where females are phenotypically different, preference is still given to collecting males. 
This is particularly concerning since most artiodactyl species are female skewed in the wild\cite{berger1999sex}.

  Only species with at least 100 specimens are included. 
  The dashed line represents 50\% female specimens. 
}
  \label{fig-orn}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Type specimens.} 
Perhaps our most notable finding focused on name bearing type specimens (holotypes, syntypes, lectotypes, and neotypes). 
Here the bias towards male specimens was extreme; only 25\% of bird and 39\% of mammal types were female (Figure A3). 
Although in some instances, males might be considered the appropriate sex for holotypes, we see no reason (other than limitations on specimens available) to not also designate a female paratype to represent the phenotypic range of a species. 
In mammals paratypes were almost 49\% female, but bird paratypes were 38\% female. 
Currently sex does not form any part of the International Code for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) recommendations for designating types, although some historical instructions for collectors emphasize the importance of multiple types (e.g.\cite{schuchert1897type}). 
Adding this to the ICZN is of vital importance moving forwards.

Museum professionals, and those using museum collections, should be aware that biases towards males exist in bird and mammal collections. 
These biases may have implications for studies that assume their samples are representative. Indeed almost all major uses of museum collections, as detailed in Table \ref{table_consequences}, may be strongly influenced by sex biases. 
It is likely that not all male bias was the result of active selection by collectors or curators; there may also be bias towards males where collecting one sex is more likely due to some sex-biased trait. 
For example, higher dispersal in males may result in males being more likely to come into contact with hunters or traps, for example when conspecific agonistic territorial behavior (e.g. calls) is used to bring individuals towards a trap. 
Males may also exhibit lower levels of neophobia increasing their likelihood of being captured though evidence for this is limited\cite{crane2017patterns,laviola1992sexual}. 
Our analyses, however, suggest that much of the male bias in collections is the result of historical active selection of males, particularly where males are the larger (for mammals at least), ``showier'' sex. 
To reduce these imbalances, collectors in the field should strive to avoid trapping biases and biases in selecting individuals to collect. 
In natural history museums, curators and collections managers should have an awareness of the biases within their collections (not just in terms of sex but also in terms of age, locality, and other factors), and attempt to acquire material to best resolve those biases, whatever their cause. 
Natural history collections play a critical role in informing multiple research disciplines answering vital questions for the future of biodiversity\cite{meineke2018biological} and are also key resources for public engagement and interaction with biodiversity\cite{machin2008}. 
Therefore it is paramount that we continue developing these resources while using a more comprehensive and better informed approach. 
Finally, researchers investigating broad-scale variation in species should account for these biases when designing data collection protocols and/or in downstream analyses and declare how they dealt with those biases in resulting publications. 
Our analyses place particular pressure on taxonomists to think more carefully about sex when defining name-bearing types, and suggest more designation of opposite sex paratypes would be desirable, particularly in birds. 



%Here we have focused on broad-scale patterns across birds and mammals, but of course more fine-scale patterns
