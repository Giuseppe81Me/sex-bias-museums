\section{Supplementary Methods}

We expect large skews in the proportion of male or female specimens when sample size is low, but the ratio of male:female specimens should approach 50:50 as more specimens are added if there is no bias. 
Most species in our dataset were represented by only a few specimens (Figure \ref{fig-histograms}), with large skews in the percentage of female specimens (in both directions) at low numbers (Figure \ref{fig-hex}).

To test whether this may influence our analyses, we used generalised linear models (GLM) with binomial errors, with the proportion of female specimens (success) and the proportion of male specimens (failure) for each species as the response variable, and the log number of specimens per species as the explanatory variable. 
We then used standard model checks for GLMs (Q-Q plot, histogram of residuals, residuals vs. linear predictors, response vs. fitted values) to assess model fit. 
The model showed massive heteroscedasticity in the residuals, due to the skew in proportions when sample size is low. 
We therefore repeated the analysis, removing species with fewer than 20, 50, 100, 150 and 200 specimens in turn. 
The best fitting model, without losing too much data, was a model with species with more than 100 specimens. 
There is still a significant positive relationship between the number of specimens and the proportion of female specimens but this is not unusual with such a large dataset, and the effect size is extremely low ($slope \pm SE = 0.034 \pm 0.001$, $z_3257 = 24.86$, $p < 0.001$) so we exclude this variable from further analyses.
